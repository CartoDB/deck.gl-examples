## Example: Heatmap using dynamic tiling over a 587k points worldwide fires dataset

This visualization showcases how easy it is with CARTO to build a heatmap from large point datasets directly from your cloud data warehouse, such as BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift or Databricks with no preprocessing thanks to CARTO dynamic tiling. As an example, it uses a 587k rows dataset of fires worldwide from NASA.

The process uses two steps:

- First, the point data is dynamically aggregated by CARTO into quadbins using the [quadbinTableSource](https://deck.gl/docs/api-reference/carto/data-sources#quadbintablesource).
- Then, the [HeatmapTileLayer](https://deck.gl/docs/api-reference/carto/heatmap-tile-layer) takes care of the heatmap rendering, with different options for styling.

Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle and serve files.

> [!WARNING]
> Please make sure you recreate the `.env` file from this repository in your Stackblitz project.

Or run it locally:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Commands:

- `npm dev` is the development target, to serve the app and hot reload.
- `npm run build` is the production target, to create the final bundle and write to disk.
