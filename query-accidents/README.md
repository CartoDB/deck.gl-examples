## Example: Accidents by state (via SQL Query + SQL Parameters)

You can use SQL to query data directly from the app, including query parameters. This increased flexibility makes CARTO a great solution to build geospatial applications.

Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle and serve files.

> [!WARNING]
> Please make sure you recreate the `.env` file from this repository in your Stackblitz project.

Or run it locally:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Commands:

- `npm dev` is the development target, to serve the app and hot reload.
- `npm run build` is the production target, to create the final bundle and write to disk.
