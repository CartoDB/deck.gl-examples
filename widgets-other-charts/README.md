## Example: Other charts

This example shows how to build custom charts and experiences using CARTO + deck.gl, by leveraging the [CARTO Widgets models](https://docs.carto.com/carto-for-developers/reference/carto-widgets-reference/models). The charts stay synchronized with the map, ans of course, they use large-scale data coming from the same cloud data warehouse as your maps.

In this case, we leverage the _Categories_ and _Table_ models in CARTO to build a fully-custom radar chart and sankey chart, respectively, with data for 3.6M Citi Bike trips in Manhattan.

The UI for the charts is built using [Apache eCharts](https://echarts.apache.org) but developers can plug their own charting or data visualization library.

Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle and serve files.
