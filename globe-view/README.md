## Example: Globe View

Data from CARTO can be used as the source for any deck.gl layer or view. In this example, we use flights data from a SQL query to CARTO to animate the flight paths in a 3D visualization using the GlobeView from deck.gl.

Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle and serve files.
